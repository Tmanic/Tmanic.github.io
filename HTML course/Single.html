    <h1>Why You Are Single In 2022</h1>
    <main>
    <p>Every now and then my friends ask me why I am single, most of the time
         I end laughing it off because at the moment I did not have an answer to that. 
       However, I have often wondered why I was and still am single. 
        As such I decided to test myself to different analogical theories 
        pertaining relationships.
       As a result the abstract and invisible things influenced my decisions 
       regarding sex, relationships, focus and general view of making commitments.</p>
    <h2>Abstract and Invisble Things</h2>   
    <p>
        Relationships are awesome, sweet and comfy, however, they are weird for a person who
         is afraid of commitments. In the development of a relationship that is talking stage
          both partners have to bask over long durations of silence and awkwardness at first.
    </p>
    <h2>You love to “simp”</h2>
    <p>
        In the modern context a simp is a person who is willing to do anything to win the
         affection, attention and love of a woman he loves. P.S. There are very few cases 
         of women simping over men.  Men who adore and worship women eventually end up being
          neglected by the woman they love.  This is because it is the innate nature and 
          nature’s law for a woman to seek for a man who can offer her protection. Simping is
           a form of weakness. 
    </p>
    <h2>They are not your type ie you are being too categorical</h2>
    <p>
        “Mchague jembe hajui kulima” the saying simply means that a farmer who is picky on the
         hoe to use, simply does not know how to farm. The saying applies realistically to men 
         who are selective of the woman they would consider to date. Although the ratio of women
          is higher than men, it does not mean that every man has two women.
