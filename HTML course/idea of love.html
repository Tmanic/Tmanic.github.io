    <h1>idea of love</h1>
    <p> 
        When i was kid I watched romantic comedy and found my inspiration...Not that am bitter about love or hate it...romantic comedy genre where the plot is always the same.A pretty man mets a pretty woman,they share a first kiss then conflicts which causes them to break up.Romantic comedy has 4 steps and this formula itself has started to irritate me.
        
        Pretty people
        Romantic comedy is a guilty pleasure which has distorted our concept of what love really is.People like to watch pretty people that's why the leads in the movie are attractive,from...I think distorts  to our culture on who is allowed to be loved and to love. Rarely there is depiction of ugly people or fat people.But what's odd is that this diss deludes people to think physical attraction to be important.But physical appearance is not everything.This genre creates an illusion of wealth,vacation,fashion...which are used to grasp the attention of the audience.I dont blame,who wants to watch a sad movie while we live in a sad one.So this is an escape.Which people fantasize about and hope they find.So the pretty person mentality comes in that someone has to reach a certain physical qualities.Not everybody is Ryan Reynolds,Ryan Gosling,Channing Tatum,Anne hathaway,Scarlett Johanson( I can continue with ehe naming but you get my point now).Dont get me wrong people can get in shape but this genre only focuses on the looks,on the idea of love at first sight."When I saw I knew she was the one".Love at first sight is a lie,there is a preferrable term to this and it is called lust.To begin with it is creepy,imagine sitting in a bar and someone stares at you from the opposite table and in their mind they have already decided you two were meant to be.Excuse me but am getting a restraining order.
        People fall in love as they get to know each other.The personality traits 
        
        First kiss
        The first kiss in this genre is supposed to be magical.There is always the awkward pause from the two antagonist,the camera spins,the light changes as they lean both of them eager yet unsure to kiss the other.And some beautiful music plays and finally after  ten seconds there is a kiss unless a friend walks in or a phone rings.We rejoice like it wasnt goin to happen,I mean it is a romantic movie people kiss.The kiss shows that the beginning is perfect,and they skip to the montage where there love is shown.This is the only part of the movie which seems to be accurate yet also wrong.Here is why?
        On the first stage  of a relationship,everybody is infatuated with the new partner.They want to be with them every time
        But that is the only part which is right,relationship which start without the friendship mostly dont tend to last for long.This has deceived the majority that you can find stranger
        
        the breakup
        Romantic comedy are aware of how simple they are.They are aware of structure,conflict and their audience.People arent perfect.Real people have relationships problems,breakup,divorces.Why else would they include breakups in their fantasies.Usually the big secret is revealed.They go their separate ways  and after a big gesture mostly from men where they chase down the woman.Then they realise the big secet that caused them to breakup  doesnt really change how they feel about each other.This is a superficial fantasy version of a breakup where the consequences are permanent and reasons are important.What about the devastating blow that comes with the breakup telling your friends,parents.What about your world feeling out of control,unbalanced.Real relationship ends because there is something wrong between two people but when your characters are flat and one dimensional to start then how can you potray that.
        Do all movies breakup have to be negative.Yes they are painful,depressing,emotional devastating but realationship can be too. The break up can be sometime be a good thing,where  someone ventures into new activities,take that trip they wanted,nature their talented or find motivation of a heartbreak song,thankyou Taylor Swift.
        
        the make up
        This part used to be my favorite part when I was a kid.After a heated argument,the girl leaves, then the boy drops everything so that he can chase after her.If you are planning to make a movie the best location for the make up are airports,train station,bus station(definitely symbolic cause this shows that the other is ready to move on,but I wont gwt to that).This reinforces the idea mostly the man has to survive the toxic behaviour of the girl to prove his manhood.The man has to compromise so as to keep the girl.In real life this is a beginning of a toxic relationship,where one party has to belittle themselves.Relationships should be equal and both parties should hear each other out.If there  ought to be any compromise is supposed to be agreed on.
