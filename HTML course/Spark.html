    <h1>My Spark</h1>
    <p>I did not choose to become a developer so as to earn lots of money and enjoy working remotely.
        I chose this line of work because it enhances my creativity as I able to work with creative people
        such as artists, celebrities and musicians. I am ideaological and believe work should not sound as an
        actual work but rather it should be a fun and engaging activity for the client and developer.
        I love to conceptualize and actualize different ideas that the client has using and improvising 
        the standard and unique template styles of a given construct.

    <h2>The power of a website</h2>
    <p>
    Social media is a powerful tool for interaction, connections and promotion of your products. 
    Engaging in appropriate spaces can see your product shoot rapidly. However, a high profiled social media
    status is not beneficial if you do not have a website. A website is necessary to divert your followers
    to an e-commerce page so they can view and purchase your product or so as to simply to know you better by 
    subscribing to your blogs and craft. Through websites you get to know and understand your
    followers better, form a community and earn money and revenue from the sale of your products
    and subscription packages. It is a win-win for you, me and your followers.
